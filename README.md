# To Do List
Supports multiple to do list folders, allows user to change due dates, and shows completed tasks. Folders and tasks are saved to local storage for easier task management.

Built with HTML, CSS (flexbox), JavaScript (ES6 modules), and Webpack.

This project is a work in progress. I am still working on making it responsive and adding the functionality to allow users to delete tasks.

You can try out the app and create your own to do lists [here](https://alinas-to-do-list.netlify.app/).
